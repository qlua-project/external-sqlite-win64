TCL

SQLite needs
  "tclsh90.exe" command-line tool as part of the build process
  "tcl90.lib" and "tclstub.lib" libraries in order to run tests

Assumes you are working with TCL version 9.0

TCL scripts used to build and/or transform source code files. For example, the tool/mksqlite3h.tcl script reads the src/sqlite.h.in file and uses it as a template to construct the deliverable "sqlite3.h" file that defines the SQLite interface.

  Recent versions of Windows have ICU built-in, so there's no need to carry a DLL or statically link it. 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/international-components-for-unicode--icu-#getting-started

  #include <icu.h>

  /link icu.lib

   nmake /f ..\Makefile.msc TOP=..\ USE_ICU=1

The USE_ICU is necessary because it not only generates the -DSQLITE_ENABLE_ICU but also the necessary /I and /LIBPATH: that will correctly include the ICU files.
